# Intelligent-Forecasting-for-Solar-Flares

## Project Overview  
This project conducts intelligent prediction research on solar flares based on magnetogram data from SDO/SHARP, SDO/HMI, and ASO-S/FMG. By integrating multi-source solar magnetosphere observation data, it constructs efficient machine learning/deep learning models to achieve advance prediction of solar flare occurrence probability and intensity, providing technical support for space weather early warning.  


## Research Background  
- **Impact of Solar Flares**: Solar flares are intense energy release phenomena in the solar atmosphere, which can trigger geomagnetic storms, ionospheric disturbances, etc., posing serious threats to satellite communications, power systems, and aerospace activities.  
- **Prediction Challenges**: Traditional physical models rely on complex magnetohydrodynamic calculations with insufficient real-time performance; the nonlinear characteristics of solar magnetic field evolution pose higher requirements for data-driven intelligent prediction methods.  
- **Data Advantages**: High-resolution magnetogram data provided by detectors such as SDO and ASO-S lay a foundation for capturing the fine structure and evolution laws of the solar magnetic field.

### Data Processing Workflow  
- **Preprocessing**: Denoising, calibration, and coordinate unification.  
- **Label Construction**: Flares are labeled by grades (C, M, X) based on X-ray flux data from GOES satellites.  


## Methodological Framework  
### Model Architecture  
1. **Spatio-temporal Model**:  
   - Spatial dimension: Fuse high-resolution details of magnetograms.  
   - Temporal dimension: Construct magnetogram sequences with multi-time windows (1-24 hours prior).  
2. **Deep Learning Model**:  
   - Backbone network: 3D convolutional neural network„ÄÅTransformer (captures spatio-temporal features).  
   - Attention mechanism: Focuses on key regions such as magnetic neutral lines and strong gradient areas.  

### Key Technologies
