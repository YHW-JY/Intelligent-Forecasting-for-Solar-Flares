# Intelligent-Forecasting-for-Solar-Flares

This project utilizes Multiscale Vision Transformer (MViT) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models for flare prediction. The code includes data preprocessing, model training, model validation, and predictive testing.

The MViT.ipynb and ViT_Auto.ipynb files in the folder provide code for data processing, model definition, model training, model validation, and model testing.
